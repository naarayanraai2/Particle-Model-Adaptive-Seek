We're going to make the adaptive seek work without collision and the paths crossing each other

Build an analysis tool that graphs the performance of the simulation. After the program is complete, 
display the plot of vehicle trajectory (position) vs time and
plot of vehicles' speed vs time at every simulation step

Trajectory plot: 
color differentiated by the speed colorbar. i.e. low speed is shown in one color and higher speed in different color

Speed plot
1. Average speed = (sum of all vehicle speed in one step)/(number of all vehicles)
2. Max speed = max{speed of all vehicles}
3. Min speed = min{speed of all vehicles}
4. Range speed = Max speed - Min speed

After one dimensional (particle) is well written later on we can add more features including 2d tracking (bicycle model) and different steering control
